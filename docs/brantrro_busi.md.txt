sensitive screens (optional)

9) API Integration Notes (from Postman)
Developer should implement strictly using Postman collections:

● Role/profile endpoints
● Listings endpoints (billboard/screen/service/template/creative)
● Orders endpoints + status transitions
● Wallet endpoints (balance, transactions, withdrawals)
● Notifications endpoints
● Messaging endpoints (if any)
● Media upload endpoints
Important: App should follow the same status transitions and validations used on the web
app.
10) Out of Scope (Explicit)
● Advertiser browsing/buying flow
● Consumer marketplace features
● Public marketing pages
● Admin dashboard features

10. QA: edge cases (network failure, upload retry, pagination, token refresh)
